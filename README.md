## Stretch Goals

Am I doing a server?
- [ ] Necessary for a blog with the ability to GET / POST to a DB
  - [ ] /blog GET for all posts
  - [ ] PROTECTED /blog POST for me to add drafts and publish posts
    - [ ] SSH key for login for siteowner??


- [ ] Could make a simple UI for quickly adding Portfolio items without jumping into the code
  - [ ] Same SSH logged in state would handle this
